Here is a very minimal crash course.\nThe most important underlying concept in R is that (almost) everything is an object.\nData Types\nR has six basic data types. The four most common types we work with are vectors, lists, matrices, and data frames.\nVectors\n\n\n## Three ways to create a vector\nv = c(1,2,3,4,5)\nv2 = seq(from=1,to=5, by = 1)\n\n## Since the sequence is counting with no breaks we can also do this\nv3 = 1:5\n\n\nVectors can also be characters (strings in other languages)\n\n\nw = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\")\nw2 = c(\"1\",\"2\",\"3\")\n\n## We can convert to other types by the as.* series \nw3 = as.character(v)\nw4 = as.numeric(w2)\n\n\nLists\n\n\nl = list(v, w)\nl\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"A\" \"B\" \"C\"\n\nMatrices\n\n\nm = matrix(seq(1,16,1), nrow = 4, byrow = T)\nm\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    1    2    3    4\n[2,]    5    6    7    8\n[3,]    9   10   11   12\n[4,]   13   14   15   16\n\nFor much more about linear algebra in R, consult the Matrix Algebra in R section.\nData Frames\n\n\ndf = data.frame(\n  var1 = letters[1:5],\n  var2 = c(1,2,3,4,5)\n)\ndf\n\n  var1 var2\n1    a    1\n2    b    2\n3    c    3\n4    d    4\n5    e    5\n\nSubsetting\nControl Operations\nFunctions\nGraphing in R\nThe Basics\nR has default plotting, but for the purpose of these notes I exclusively use ggplot2. A main distinction between base plotting and ggplot2 is that ggplot2 requires a data frame and presumes that your data is tidy.\n\n\n## Using the built-in dataset diamonds\ndf = diamonds\n\n## Data\ndf |>\n  ## Mapping\n  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price)) +\n  ## geom\n  geom_point() +\n  ## we can have multiple geoms \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = F)+\n  ## Labels\n  labs(x = \"Carat\",\n       y = \"Price\",\n       title = \"Example Chart\")+\n  ## theme \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\nFor more extensive discussion of graphing capabilities in R, check out Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction by Healy.\nUseful Plots for Political Science\nCoefficient Plot\nFirst let’s make a model using the gapminder dataset.\n\n\n## Make a model with robust standard errors using the gapminder\n## dataset\nm1 = fixest::feols(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap + pop + continent, data = gapminder::gapminder, vcov = \"HC1\") |>\n  tidy(conf.int = TRUE)\n\nhead(m1)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value conf.low conf.high\n  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)  4.78e+1   3.79e-1    126.   0         4.71e+1   4.86e+1\n2 gdpPercap    4.50e-4   7.27e-5      6.19 7.67e-10  3.07e-4   5.92e-4\n3 pop          6.57e-9   1.52e-9      4.32 1.66e- 5  3.59e-9   9.55e-9\n4 continentA…  1.35e+1   6.98e-1     19.3  3.06e-75  1.21e+1   1.48e+1\n5 continentA…  8.19e+0   6.87e-1     11.9  1.44e-31  6.85e+0   9.54e+0\n6 continentE…  1.75e+1   9.88e-1     17.7  2.47e-64  1.55e+1   1.94e+1\n\n\n\nm1 |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = term, y = estimate, \n             ymin = conf.low, \n             ymax = conf.high))+\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_pointrange() + \n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"\",\n       y = \"Coefficient Estimates\",\n       title = \"Coefficient Plot\")\n\n\n\nAdded Variable Plots\nMarginal Effects Plots\n\n\nmarginModel = fixest::feglm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap + pop + continent, data = gapminder::gapminder, vcov = \"HC1\") |>\n  marginaleffects::slopes(by = TRUE)\n\n\nSimulations in R\nThe Birthday Problem\n\n\n\n",

In the next set of notes, we will extend this model to situations where we have more than one covariate.\nWe can think of \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x\\) as the systematic part of y whereas u is the unsystematic part of y. That is, u represents y not explained by x.\nError Term Assumptions\nIn order to make progress, we make the following assumptions about the error term.\n\\(E[u] = 0\\) as long as an intercept term is included in the equation. Note that this essentially defines the intercept.\n\\(E[u|x] = E[u] = 0\\). This is the Zero Conditional Mean Assumption for the error term.\nThe average value of the unobservables is the same across all slices of the population determined by the value of x and is equal to the average of u over the entire population\nBy EA.1 that means the average is 0\nDeriving OLS Estimates\nTo estimate the Population Regression Function (PRF), we need a sample.\nLet \\((x_i, y_i): i = 1,...,n\\) be a random sample of size n from the population. We can estimate the PRF by a model:\n\\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i + u_i\\) (E.2)\nError Assumption 2 implies that in the popuation x and u are uncorrelated, and the zero conditional mean assumption for the error implies that \\(E[u] = 0\\). This implies that the covariance between x and u is 0 or formally:\n\\(Cov(x,u) = E(xu) = 0\\)\nWe can rewrite previous equations as follows\n\\(E[u] = E[ y - \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x]\\) (E.3)\n\\(Cov(x,u) = E[x(y - \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x)]\\) (E.4)\nOur goal is to choose sample \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\),\\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) to solve the sample equations:\n\\(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y - \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x = 0\\) (E.5)\n\\(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i(y - \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x) = 0\\) (E.6)\nRewrite E.4\n\\(\\bar{y} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}\\bar{x}\\) which implies\n\\(\\beta_0 = \\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta_1}\\bar{x}\\)\nEstimating The Slope Parameter\nDrop the \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) in E.5 because it does not affect the solution. Plug in \\(\\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta_1}\\bar{x}\\) for \\(\\beta_0\\) which yields the equation\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i(\\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta_1}\\bar{x}) - \\hat{\\beta_1}x) = 0\\)\nRearrange terms to get the y’s and the x’s on opposite sides of the equation.\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i(y_i - \\bar{y})\\)\n\\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\sum x_i(x_i - \\bar{x})\\)\nSetting these equal to each other and using properties of the sum operator, we can rewrite the the top sum to be \\(Cov(x,y)\\) and the bottom sum to \\(V(x)\\). As long as \\(V(x) > 0\\),\n\\(\\hat{\\beta_1} = \\frac{\\hat{Cov(x,y)}}{\\hat{V(x)}}\\)\nIn words, the slope parameter estimate is the sample covariance of x and y divided by the sample variance of x. We refer to this as the OLS procedure and the OLS regression line as\n\\(\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x\\)\nAlgebraic Properties of OLS on Any Sample of Data\nThe following hold by construction for any sample of data estimated by OLS\nThe sum and therefore sample average of the residuals is 0. This is because the OLS estimates are chosen to make the residuals sum to 0.\nSample covariance between regressors and OLS residuals is 0\nThe point \\((\\bar{x}, \\bar{y})\\) is always on the OLS regression line\nVariation in Y\nWe can view OLS as decomposing each \\(y_i\\) into two parts, a fitted value and a residual. There are three parts of this decomposition: the total sum of squares (SST), the explained sum of squares (SSE), and the residual sum of squares (SSR).\n\\(SST = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -\\bar{y})^2\\)\n\\(SSE = \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\hat{y_i} -\\bar{y})^2\\)\n\\(SSR = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{u}^2\\)\nSST is a measure of total sample variation in the \\(y_i\\)’s. Dividing SST by n-1 gets us the sample variance of y.\nThe Total Variation in y is SST = SSE + SSR.\nTo derive\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i -\\bar{y})^2\\)\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^n [(y_i - \\hat{y_i}) + (\\hat{y_i}-\\bar{y})]^2\\)\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{u_i} + (\\hat{y_i}-\\bar{y})]^2\\)\nExpand out the sum and replace with definitions to get\n\\(SSR + 2Cov(\\hat{u}, \\hat{y}) + SSE\\)\nSince the covariance between u and y is 0, that term drops out.\nGoodness of Fit\nThe ratio of the explained sample variation in y by x is known as \\(R^2\\) and defined:\n\\(R^2 = 1 - \\frac{SSR}{SST}\\)\nExpected Values and Unbiasedness of OLS Estimators\nOLS is an unbiased estimator of the population model provided the following assumptions hold. These assumptions are also known as Gauss-Markov assumptions.\nA1. Linear in paramters\nIn the population model, y is related to x and u\n$y = _0 + _1x + u $\nA2. Random Sample\nWe have a random sample of size n from the population model\nA3. Sample variation in x\nThe sample outcomes \\(x_i: i = 1,2,..., n\\) are not all the same value. If they are, there is no variance of X and so \\(\\beta_1\\) cannot be estimated.\nA4. Zero Conditional Mean of the Error\nFor a random sample, this assumption implies\n\\(E(u_i|x_i) = 0: \\forall i \\in [0,1,...n]\\)\nA4 is violated whenever we think that u and x are correlated. In the simple bivariate case, an example might be using the variable education to predict salary. education is correlated with many variables, including income and family history. These may affect salary and therefore will give us biased results.\nNote: We can write the slope estimator \\(\\beta_1\\) in a slightly different way\n\\(\\hat{\\beta_1} = \\frac{\\sum\\_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})*(\\beta_0 - \\beta_1x + u_i)}{SST_x}\\)\n\\(\\hat{\\beta_1} = \\beta\\_0 \\sum\\_{i=1}^n\\) + _1_{i=1}^n x_i(x_i -{x}) + _{i=1}^n u_i(x_i - {x})$\nThe first term sums to 0 and drops out. Thus:\n\\(\\hat{\\beta_1} = \\beta_1 + \\frac{\\sum\\_{i=1}^n u_i(x_i - \\bar{x})}{SST_x}\\)\nWe now have all the information we need to prove that OLS is unbiased. Unbiasedness is a feature of the sampling distributions of \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\). Unbiasedness says nothing about the estimates for any given sample we may draw.\nTheorem 1: Using A1-A4 OLS produces unbiased estimates\n\\(E(\\hat{\\beta_0}) = \\beta_0\\) and \\(E(\\hat{\\beta_1}) = \\beta_1\\)for any values of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\).\nProof:\nIn this proof the expected values are conditional on sample values of the independent variable x. Because \\(SST_x\\) and \\((x_i - \\bar(x))\\) are functions on of \\(x_i\\) they are non-random once we condition on x.\n\\(E\\hat{\\beta_1}] = E\\beta_1 + \\frac{\\sum\\_{i=1}^n u_i(x_i - \\bar{x})}{SST_x}]\\)\n\\(E\\hat{\\beta_1}] = \\beta_1 + \\frac{\\sum\\_{i=1}^n E[u_i(x_i - \\bar{x})]}{SST_x}\\)\n\\(E\\hat{\\beta_1}] = \\beta_1 + \\frac{\\sum\\_{i=1}^n 0 (x_i - \\bar{x})}{SST_x}\\)\n\\(E\\hat{\\beta_1}] = \\beta_1\\)\nWe can also prove the same for \\(\\beta_0\\).\n\\(E\\hat{\\beta_0}] = \\beta_0 + E[(\\beta_1 - \\hat{\\beta_1}\\bar{x} + E\\bar{u}]\\)\n\\(E\\hat{\\beta_0}] = \\beta_0 + E[(\\beta_1 - \\hat{\\beta_1}\\bar{x} + 0\\)\n\\(E\\hat{\\beta_0}] = \\beta_0\\)\nIn the last equation, because \\(\\hat{\\beta_1} = \\beta_1\\) the second term drops out.\nVariances of OLS Estimators\nAn additional assumption we can make about the variance of the OLS estimators is that the error u has the same variances conditional on any value of the explanatory variable.\n\\(V(u|x) = \\sigma^2\\)\nBy adding this assumption, which to be clear will break down horribly if it is violated, we can prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 2: Using assumptions 1-4 and homoskedastic error assumption\n\\(V(\\hat{\\beta_1}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{SST_x}\\) and \\(V(\\hat{\\beta_0}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\_{i=1}^n x_i^2}{\\sum\\_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\\)\nwhere these are conditioned on the sample values.\nProof for \\(V(\\hat{\\beta_1})\\)\n\\(V(\\hat{\\beta_1}) = \\frac{1^2}{SST_x^2}V(\\sum\\_{i=1}^n u_i(x_i - \\bar{x}))\\)\nSubstitute \\(d_i = (x_i - \\bar{x})\\)\n\\(V(\\hat{\\beta_1}) = \\frac{1^2}{SST_x^2}\\sum\\_{i=1}^n u_i d_i^2\\)\nSince \\(V(u_i) = \\sigma^2 : \\forall i\\) we can substitute that constant into the equation.\n\\(V(\\hat{\\beta_1}) = \\frac{1}{SST_x^2}\\sigma^2 \\sum\\_{i=1}^n d_i^2\\)\nObserve that the second RHS term is just \\(SST_x\\) after pulling out the constant, we can rewrite as\n\\(V(\\hat{\\beta_1}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2 SST_x}{SST_x^2}\\)\nwhich reduces to our stated result.\nNow that we know the way to estimate the variance, we can ask the following question. How does \\(V(\\hat{\\beta_1})\\) depend on error variance?\nThe larger the error variance, the larger \\(V(\\hat{\\beta_1})\\).\nThe larger the \\(V(x)\\), the smaller \\(V(\\hat{\\beta_1})\\)\nAs sample size increases, the total variation in x increases which leads to a decrease in \\(V(\\hat{\\beta_1})\\)\nEstimating the Error Variance\nErrors are never observed. Instead, we observe residuals that we can compute from our sample data. We can write the errors as a function of the residuals.\n\\(\\hat{u_i} = u_i - (\\hat{\\beta_0} - \\beta_0) - (\\hat{\\beta_1} - \\beta_1)x\\)\nOne problem that we run into is that using the residuals as an estimator is biased without correction because it does not take into account two restrictions for OLS residuals. OLS residuals have to sum to 0 and have a 0 covariance between x and u. Formally,\n\\(\\sum\\_{i=1}^n \\hat{u_i} = 0\\)\nand\n\\(\\sum\\_{i=1}^n \\hat{u_i}x_i = 0\\).\nThus we need to correct by n-2 degrees of freedom for an unbiased estimator. When we do so, we get the following.\n\\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\hat{s}^2 = \\frac{1}{n-2}\\sum\\_{i=1}^n\\hat{u_i}^2\\)\n\\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{SSR}{n-2}\\)\nMultiple Linear Regression\nWe are now going to extend our previous discussion of Simple Linear Regression into the multiple variate case. Here we consider models that include more than one independent variable.\n\\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x\\_2 + ... + \\beta_kx\\_k + u\\)\nwhere \\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept, \\(\\beta_1\\) measures change in y with respect to \\(x_1\\) holding all other covariates fixed and so on.\nAs shorthand we refer to parameters other than the intercept as slope parameters.\nWe can generalize the zero conditional mean assumption for the errors to be\n\\(E(U|x\\_1, x\\_2, ..., x\\_k) = 0\\)\nMechanics and Interpretation of OLS\nOur goal is to get estimates \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1,...,\\beta_k\\). We choose these to minimize the sum of squared residuals\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^n\\hat{y_i} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x\\_{i1}+...+ \\hat{\\beta_k}x\\_{ik}\\)\nThis minimization leads to k + 1 linear equations in k + 1 unknowns. We call these the OLS first order equations.\nOLS Fitted Values and Residuals\nFor observation i the fitted values are:\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^n\\hat{y_i} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}x\\_{i1}+...+ \\hat{\\beta_k}x\\_{ik}\\)\nRecall that OLS minimizes the average square prediction error which says nothing about any given prediction. The residual is generalized from the simple linear regression case to be:\n\\(\\hat{u_i} = y_i - \\hat{y_i}\\)\nProperties of fitted values and residuals\nThe sample average of the residuals is 0. \\(\\bar{y} = \\hat{\\bar{y}}\\)\nSample covariance between each independent variable and the residuals is 0 by construction\nThe average point is always on the regression line by construction.\nGoodness of Fit\nLike before SST = SSE + SSR and \\(R^2 = 1 - \\frac{SSR}{SST}\\)\nExpected Value of OLS Estimators\nWe restate the assumptions needed for OLS regressions\nLinear in Parameters\nThe model can be written as \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x\\_1 + \\.\\.\\. + \\beta_kx\\_k\\)\nRandom sampling\nWe have a random sample of n observations \\({(x\\_{i1}, x\\_{i2}, ..., x\\_{ik}): i = 1,2,..., n}\\)\nNo perfect collinearity\nIn the sample (and therefore population) none of the independent variables is constant and there are no exact linear relationships among the independent variables\nZero Conditional Mean of Error\n\\(E(u|x_1, x_2, ..., x_k) = 0\\)\nThis implies that none of the independent variables are correlated with the error term\nIf these four assumptions hold\nTheorem 3.1: OLS is unbiased\n\\(E(\\hat{\\beta_j} = \\beta_j : j = 1,2,\\.\\.\\.,k)\\)\nfor any values of the population parameter \\(\\beta_j\\)\nNote: Adding irrelevant independent variables does not effect unbiasedness. These terms will on average be 0 across many samples. Adding irrelevant independent variables will hurt the estimator’s variances.\nOmitted Variable Bias\nA major problem that will lead to bias in our estimates is omitting a relevant variable from our model. To see why suppose we have the following population model\n\\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + u\\)\nbut we only run the regression\n\\(y = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\beta_1x\\)\nFor example, we want to estimate the effect of education on wages but do not include some measure of innate ability.\nSince the model is misspecified, we can define bias as:\n\\(\\tilde{\\beta_1} = \\hat{\\beta_1} + \\hat{\\beta_2}\\tilde{\\delta_1}\\)\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}, \\hat{\\beta_2}\\) are slope estimator from the regression $y_i $ on \\(x_1, x_2\\) and \\(\\tilde{\\delta_1}\\) is the slope from the regression \\(x\\_{i2}\\) on \\(x\\_{i1}\\).\n\\(\\tilde{\\delta_1}\\) depends only on the independent variables in the sample so we can treat it as a fixed quanitty when computing \\(E[\\tilde{\\beta_1}]\\)\n\\(E[\\tilde{\\beta_1}] = E[\\hat{\\beta_1} + \\hat{\\beta_2}\\tilde{\\delta_1}]\\)\n\\(E[\\tilde{\\beta_1}] = E[\\hat{\\beta_1} + \\tilde\\delta_1\\hat{\\beta_2}]\\)\n\\(E[\\tilde{\\beta_1}] = \\beta_1 + \\tilde\\delta_1\\beta_2\\)\nwhich implies that the omitted variable bias is \\(\\beta_2\\tilde{\\delta_1}\\)\nThe bias in the model is 0 if:\n\\(\\beta_2 = 0\\)\n\\(\\tilde{\\delta_1}=0\\)\nwhich occurs if and only if \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are uncorrelated in the sample.\nVariance of OLS Estimators\nKeeping our previous Multiple Linear Regression assumptions we add\nAssumption 5: Homoskedasticity of errors\nThe error u has the same variance given any values of the explanatory variables.\n\\(V(u| x_1, x_2, ..., x_k)=\\sigma^2\\)\nTheorem 2\nUnder assumptions 1-5 conditional on the sample values of the independent variables\n\\(v(\\hat{\\beta_j}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{{SST}_j(1-R_j^2)}\\)\nand\n\\(E[\\hat{\\sigma%^2}= \\sigma^2]\\)\nThe unbiased estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\) is \\(\\hat{\\sigma^2}= \\frac{1}{n-k-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{u_i}^2\\) where n is the number of observations and k + 1 is the number of parameters.\nThe standard error of \\(\\hat{\\beta_j}\\) is\n\\(se(\\hat{\\beta_j})= \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt{{SST}_j(1-\\hat{R_j}^2)}}\\)\nEfficiency Properties of OLS\nThe OLS estimator \\(\\hat{\\beta_j}\\) for \\(\\beta_j\\) is BLUE: The Best Linear Unbiased Estimator.\nestimator: rule that can be applied to data to generate an estimate\nunbiased \\(E[\\hat{\\beta_j}]=\\beta_j\\) for any estimator\nlinear: An estimator is linear if it can be expressed as a linear function of the data on the dependent variable\nbest: Gauss-Markov holds that for any estimator \\(\\tilde{\\beta_j}\\) that is linear and unbiased \\(V(\\hat{\\beta_j}) \\leq V(\\tilde{\\beta_j})\\). That is the OLS estimator has at least as small if not smaller variance than any other linear unbiased estimator.\nFrom our previous assumptions we add an additional assumption.\nAssumption 6: Normality\nThe population error u is independent of the explanatory variables \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_k\\) and is normally distributed as \\(u \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\)\nAssumption 6 is strong and amounts to also assuming MLR Assumption 4 and MLR Assumption 5. Taken together, the six assumptions we’ve made so far collectively are the classical linear model (CLM) assumptions.\nWe can summarise the CLM as:\n\\(y|\\textbf{x} \\sim N(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x\\_{ik} + ... + \\beta_kx\\_{ik}, \\sigma^2)\\)\nwhere \\(\\textbf{x}\\) is shorthand for \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_k\\)\nNote: Problems with Normal Error Assumption\nFactors in u can have very different distributions in the population. While central limit theorems can still hold, the normal approximation can be poor.\nCentral limit theorem arguments assume all error affects y in separate additive fashion which has no guarantee of truth. Any breakdown in this assumption will break this assumption\nIn any given application, normal error assumptions are an empirical matter. In general the assumption will be false if y takes on just a few possible values.\nTheorem 4.1: Normality of error terms lead to normality of sampling distributions of OLS estimators\nUnder the CLM assumptions (MLR Assumptions 1-6) conditional on the sample values of the independent variables\n\\(\\hat{\\beta_j} \\sim N(\\beta_j, V(\\beta_j))\\) which implies\n\\(\\frac{\\hat{\\beta_j} - \\beta_j}{V(\\hat{\\beta_j})} \\sim N(0,1)\\)\nTesting hypotheses about a single population parameter: The t-test\nTheorem 4.2: t distribution for standard errors\nUnder the CLM assumptions (MLR Assumptions 1-6)\n\\(\\frac{\\hat{\\beta_j} - \\beta_j}{se(\\hat{\\beta_j})} \\sim t\\_{n-k-1} = t\\_{df}\\)\nwhere k+1 is the number of paramters in the population model and n-k-1 is the degrees of freedom.\nTheorem 2 is important because it allows us to test hypotheses involving \\(\\beta_j\\). The test statistic we use is the t-statistic.\n\\(t_{\\hat{\\beta_j}} = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta_j}}{se(\\hat{\\beta_j})}\\)\nNull Hypothesis Tests\nThe most common hypothesis test is a two-sided alternative\n\\(H_0: \\beta_j = 0\\)\n\\(H_a: \\beta_j \\neq 0\\)\nWe can also test against one sided alternatives where we expect\n\\(H_0: \\beta_j \\leq 0\\)\n\\(H_a: \\beta_j > 0\\)\nor the reverse.\nA p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic, in this case a t-statistic, as extreme as the one we observed given that the null hypothesis is true.\nTesting Hypotheses about a single linear combination of Parameters\nOur t-statistic keeps the same general format but changes slightly.\n\\(t = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta_j} - \\hat{\\beta_k}}{se(\\hat{\\beta_j} - \\hat{\\beta_k})}\\)\nwhere\n\\(se(\\hat{\\beta_j} - \\hat{\\beta_k}) = \\sqrt{se(\\hat{\\beta_j})^2 + se(\\hat{\\beta_k})^2 + 2Cov(\\hat{\\beta_j},\\hat{\\beta_k})}\\)\nSome guidelines for discussing signficance of a variable in a MLR model\nCheck for statistical significance. If yes, discuss the magnitude of the coefficient to get an idea of its practical importance.\nIf variable isn’t significant, look at whether the variable has the expected effect and if it is practically large.\nConfidence Intervals\nA confidence interval is if random samples were obtained infinitely many times with \\(\\tilde{\\beta_j}, \\hat{\\beta_j}\\) computed each time then the (unknown) \\(\\beta_j\\) population value would lie in the interval \\((\\tilde{\\beta_j}, \\hat{\\beta_j})\\) for 95% of the samples.\nUnder the CLM assumptions, a confidence interval is\n\\(\\hat{\\beta_j} \\pm \\alpha SE(\\hat{\\beta_j})\\)\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is a critical value\nTesting Multiple Linear Restrictions: The F-test\nOften we want to test whether a group of variables have no effect on the dependenet variables.\nThe null hypothesis is that a set of variables has no effect on y, once another set of variables have been controlled.\nIn contest to hypothesis testing:\nThe restricted model is the model without hte groups of variables we are testing\nThe unrestricted model is the model of all the parameters\nFor the general case:\nThe unrestricted model with k independent variables \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 +...+ \\beta_k x_k + u\\)\nThe null hypothesis is \\(H_0: \\beta\\_{k-q-1} = 0,..., \\beta_k = 0\\) which puts q exclusion restrictions on the model\nThe F-statistic is:\n\\(F = \\frac{\\frac{SSR_r - SSR\\_{ur}}{q}}{\\frac{SSR\\_{ur}}{n-k-1}}\\)\nwhere \\(SSR_r\\) is the sum of squared residuals from the restricted model and \\(SSR\\_{ur}\\) is the sum of squared residuals from the unrestricted model and q is the numerator degrees of freedom which is the degrees of freedom in the restricted model minus the degrees of freedom in the unrestricted model.\nThe F-statistic is always non-negative. If \\(H_0\\) is rejected then we say that \\(x\\_{k-q+1},...x_k\\) are jointly statistically significant. If we fail to reject then the variables are jointly statistically insignificant.\nThe R-Squared Form of the F-statistic\nUsing the fact that \\(SSR_r = SST(1-R_r^2)\\) and \\(SSR\\_{ur} = SST(1 - R\\_{ur}^2)\\) we can substitute in to the F-statistic to get\n\\(F = \\frac{\\frac{R\\_{ur}^2 - R_r^2}{q}}{\\frac{1-R\\_{ur}^2}{n-k-1}}\\)\nThis is often more convenient for testing exclusion restrictions in models but cannot test all linear restrictions.\nOLS Asympotics\nWe know under certain assumptions that OLS estimators are unbiased, but unbiasedness cannot always be achieved for an estimator. Another property that we are interested in is whether an estimator is consistent.\nTheorem 5.1: OLS is a consistent estimator\nUnder MLR Assumptions 1-4, the OLS estimator \\(\\hat{\\beta_j}\\) is consistent for \\(\\beta_j \\forall \\\\ j \\in 1,2,...,k\\).\nInformally, as n tends to infinitythe distribution of \\(\\hat{\\beta_j}\\) collapses to the single point \\(\\beta_j\\)\nWe can add an assumption MLR 4’:\n\\(E(u) = 0,Cov(x_j, u) = 0 \\forall j \\in 1,2,...,k\\)\nThis is a weaker assumption than MLR 4. MLR 4’ requires only that \\(x_j\\) is uncorrelated with u and that u has zero mean in the population. Indeed MLR 4 implies MLR 4’.\nWe use MLR4 as an assumption because OLS is biased but consistent under MLR 4’ if \\(E[u| x_1, ..., x_k]\\) depends on any of the \\(x_j\\). Second, if MLR 4 holds, then we have properly modeled the population regression function.\nDeriving Inconsistency of OLS\nCorrelation between u and any of the \\(x_1, ..., x_k]\\) generally causes all of the OLS estimators to be inconsistent. If the error is correlated with any of the independent variables then OLS is biased and inconsistent.\nThere is an asymptotic analogue to Omitted Variable Bias. Suppose the model \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + v\\) satisfies MLR assumptions 1-4. If we omit \\(x_2\\) then:\n\\(plim\\tilde{\\beta_1} = \\beta_1 + \\beta_2\\delta_1\\)\n\\(plim\\tilde{\\beta_1} = \\beta_1 + \\beta_2\\frac{Cov(x_1,x_2)}{V(x_1)}\\)\nIf the covariance term is zero then the estimator is still consistent. Otherwise, the inconsistency takes on the same sign as the covariance term.\nAsymptotic Normality and Large Sample Inference\nIn cases where the \\(y_i\\) do not follow normal distributions we can still get asymptotic normality.\nTheorem 5.2: Asymptotic Normality\nUnder MLR Assumptions 1-5\n\\(\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{\\beta_j} - \\beta_j) \\xrightarrow{a} N(0, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{a_j^2}\\) where \\(a_j^2\\) is the asymptotic variance of \\(\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{\\beta_j} - \\beta_j)\\). For the slope coefficients \\(a\\_j^2 = plim(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum\\_{i=1}^n \\hat{r\\_{ij}^2})\\) where the \\(r\\_{ij}\\) are the residuals from regressing \\(x_j\\) on the other independent variables.\n\\(\\hat{\\sigma^2}\\) is a consistent estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\)\nFor each j\n\\(\\frac{\\hat{\\beta_j} - \\beta_j}{sd(\\hat{\\beta_j})} \\xrightarrow{a} N(0,1)\\) which we cannot compute from data and\n\\(\\frac{\\hat{\\beta_j} - \\beta_j}{se(\\hat{\\beta_j})} \\xrightarrow{a} N(0,1)\\) which we can compute from data.\nThis theorem does not require MLR 6 from the list of required assupmtions. What this theorem says is that regardless of the population distribution of u, the OLS estimators when properly standardized have approximate standard normal distributions.\nFurther,\n\\(\\frac{\\hat{\\beta_j} - \\beta_j}{se(\\hat{\\beta_j})} \\xrightarrow{a} t\\_{df}\\)\nbecause \\(t\\_{df}\\) approaches $ N(0,1)$ as the degrees of freedom gets large so we can carry out t-tests and confidence intervals in the same way as the CLM assumptions.\nRecall that \\(\\widehat{V(\\hat{\\beta_j})} = \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma^2}}{SST_j(1-R_j^2)}\\) where \\(SST_j\\) is the total sum of squares of \\(x_j\\) in the sample and \\(R_j^2\\) is the R-squared from regressing \\(x_j\\) on all other independent variables. As the sample size increases:\n\\(\\hat{\\sigma^2} \\xrightarrow{d} \\sigma^2\\)\n\\(R_j^2 \\xrightarrow{d} c\\) which is some number between 0 and 1\nThe sample variance \\(\\frac{SST_j}{n} \\xrightarrow{d} V(x_j)\\)\nThese imply that \\(\\widehat{V(\\hat{\\beta_j})}\\) shrinks to 0 at the rate of \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) and \\(se(\\hat{\\beta_j}) = \\frac{c_j}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) where \\(c_j = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sigma\\sqrt{1 - \\rho_j^2}}\\).\nThis last equation is an approximation. A good rule of thumb is that standard eerrors can be expected to shrink at a rate that is the inverse of the square root of the sample size.\nAsymptotic Efficiency of OLS\nTheorem 5.3\nUnder Gauss-Markov assumptions, let \\(\\tilde{\\beta_j}\\) denote estimators that solve the equation\n\\(\\sum\\_{i=1}^n g_j(\\textbf{x}_i)(y_i - \\tilde{\\beta_0}-\\tilde{\\beta_1}x\\_{i1} - ... - \\tilde{\\beta_k}x\\_{ik}) = 0\\)\nLet \\(\\hat{\\beta_j}\\) denote the OLS estimators. The OLS estimators have the smallest asymptotic variance.\n\\(AVar(\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{\\beta_j} - \\beta_j)) \\leq AVar(\\sqrt{n}(\\tilde{\\beta_j} - \\beta_j))\\)\n\n\n\n",

Formally, a norm is a function \\(||\\cdot||\\) that maps a vector to a scalar which satisfies:\nGiven any vector x \\(||\\alpha x|| = |\\alpha|||x||\\).\nFor any vectors x, y, norms satisfy the triangle inequality \\(||x + y|| \\leq ||x|| + ||y||\\)\nThe norm of a vector \\(||x|| > 0\\hspace \\forall x \\neq 0\\)\nThe most common norm is the \\(\\ell_2\\) norm or Euclidean norm which is defined as \\(||x||_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}\\)\n\n\nx = c(3,-4)\nl2 = sqrt(crossprod(x,x))\nl2\n\n     [,1]\n[1,]    5\n\n## We can also call R's built in norm() function \nnorm(x, \"2\")\n\n[1] 5\n\nIn python\n\nx = np.array([3,-4])\nnp.linalg.norm(x)\n5.0\n\nWe sometimes take the Manhattan norm (\\(\\ell_1\\)) which sums the absolute values of a vectors elements \\(||x||_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^n|x_i|\\)\n\n\nx = c(3,-4)\nl1 = function(x){\n  return(sum(abs(x)))\n}\nl1(x)\n\n[1] 7\n\nIn python\n\nx = np.array([3,-4])\nnp.linalg.norm(x, 1)\n7.0\n\nThe infinity norm or max norm (\\(\\ell_\\infty\\)) is common in machine learning applications defined as \\(||x||_\\infty = \\max_i |x_i|\\), which simplifies to the absolute value of the element with the largest magnitude in the vector.\n\n\nx = matrix(c(3,-4), byrow = T, nrow = 2)\nnorm(x, type =\"I\")\n\n[1] 4\n\nl_inf = function(x){\n  return(max(abs(x)))\n}\nl_inf(c(3,-4))\n\n[1] 4\n\nIn python\n\nx = np.array([3,-4])\nmax(abs(x))\n4\n\nOrdinary Least Squares\nThe simplest linear model expresses the dependence of a dependent or response variable y on independent variables \\(x_1,.., x_p\\) and is usually written \\(y = X\\beta + \\epsilon\\). See the Lecture Notes for more details on the properties of this model.\nDefine the design matrix as the \\(n \\times p\\) matrix of independent variables \\(x_1,..,x_p\\) and assume that the first columns is a column of ones and that the design matrix has full rank.
